## Question 1. Understanding Docker images
Run docker with the python:3.13 image. Use an entrypoint bash to interact with the container.  
What's the version of pip in the image?  
```
$ docker run -it python:3.13 bash
root@45fdc0adf0cb:/# pip --version
pip 25.3 from /usr/local/lib/python3.13/site-packages/pip (python 3.13)
```
25.3  

## Question 2. Understanding Docker networking and docker-compose
Given the following docker-compose.yaml, what is the hostname and port that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?  

```
services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```
db:5432  

## Question 3. Counting short trips
For the trips in November 2025 (lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01', exclusive of the upper bound), how many trips had a trip_distance of less than or equal to 1 mile?  
```
select
	count(*)
from green_taxi_data
where lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-01' and '2025-12-01'
and trip_distance <= 1
```
8007  

## Question 4. Longest trip for each day
Which was the pick up day with the longest trip distance? Only consider trips with trip_distance less than 100 miles (to exclude data errors).  

Use the pick up time for your calculations.  
```
select
	lpep_pickup_datetime,
	trip_distance
from green_taxi_data
where trip_distance < 100
order by trip_distance desc
```
2025-11-14 15:36:27  

## Question 5. Biggest pickup zone
Which was the pickup zone with the largest total_amount (sum of all trips) on November 18th, 2025?  
```
select
	zpu."Zone",
	sum(total_amount) as total_amount
from green_taxi_data as t
left join zones as zpu on t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
where lpep_pickup_datetime between '2025-11-18' and '2025-11-19'
group by zpu."Zone"
order by total_amount desc
```
"East Harlem North"	9281.919999999996

## Question 6. Largest tip
For the passengers picked up in the zone named "East Harlem North" in November 2025, which was the drop off zone that had the largest tip?  

Note: it's tip , not trip. We need the name of the zone, not the ID.  
```
select
	zdo."Zone" as DO_zone,
	tip_amount
from green_taxi_data as t
left join zones as zpu on t."PULocationID" = zpu."LocationID"
left join zones as zdo on t."DOLocationID" = zdo."LocationID"
where zpu."Zone" = 'East Harlem North'
order by tip_amount desc
```
